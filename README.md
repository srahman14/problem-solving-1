# Problem Solving 1

Problem 1: My Sequence, My Rule
Create a custom number sequence by defining your own growth rules. Start with two numbers of your choice and generate the sequence using distinct rules for different positions (e.g., sums, products). Write a Python program that displays the name and rules of the sequence, then prompts the user to enter a number N to generate the first N terms.

Problem 2: Total Recall 
Develop a memory game that matches digits between two grids, each using a different numeral system (like Arabic and Bengali). The user will input two positions (one for each grid), and the game will check if the selected digits match. If they match, they remain visible; otherwise, they are hidden again. The game continues until all matching pairs are revealed.

Problem 3: Jiuzhang suanshu 
Solve a real-world problem involving a system of linear equations. For example, use a set of chemical concentrations in different beakers and solve for the unknown concentrations using determinants. Write a Python program that computes the solution by finding the determinant of the coefficient matrix, ensuring a unique solution.

Problem 4: Sophie in Paris 
Design an Inventory Management System for Sophie’s Boutique, enabling her to add, update, remove, and display inventory items, as well as calculate the total inventory value. The system should use Python’s dictionary data structure and handle errors like invalid input or removing nonexistent items.
